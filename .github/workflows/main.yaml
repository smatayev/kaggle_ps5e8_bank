# This is a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the ML pipeline

name: Kaggle Submission CI/CD

# This workflow triggers on any push to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-submit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a standard Linux virtual machine

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9' # Match your local environment

      # Step 3: Install Python dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Set up DVC using the modern action
      # FIX: Replaced the old 'dvc-action' with the new 'setup-dvc'
      - name: Set up DVC
        uses: iterative/setup-dvc@v1

      # Step 5: Pull DVC data
      # This step remains the same, but now runs after DVC is properly set up
      - name: Pull DVC data
        run: dvc pull

      # Step 6: Run the full pipeline to generate the submission file
      - name: Train final model
        run: python src/train_final_model.py

      - name: Generate predictions
        run: python src/predict.py

      # Step 7: Set up Kaggle credentials from the GitHub Secret
      - name: Set up Kaggle credentials
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
          echo "${{ secrets.KAGGLE_JSON }}" > ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
          chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
      
      # Step 8: Submit to Kaggle
      - name: Submit to Kaggle
        run: python src/submit.py
